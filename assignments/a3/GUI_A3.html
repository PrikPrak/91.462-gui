  NOTES:
  I've done my best to ensure the code and page itself is organized well. Please do let me know if there's any portion of the file that you'd like me to elaborate on. I'd be more than happy to oblige!

  09/25/2013 - Added a youtube video "post" to the page. Added icons.
  09/24/2013 - This page has been designed to look KIND of like a blog. Each div kind of represents a post.

    <h3>My Sidekick</h3>
    <p>This is my dog, Hadouken, named after Ryu's iconic special move, who's from the Street Fighter video game franchise. He's almost two years old, and is supposedly a Rat Terrier and German Shepherd mix. We're still waiting for him to finish his puppy phase and calm down.</p>
