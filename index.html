  <h1>Corey Prak, corey_prak@student.uml.edu</h1>
  <p>Hello, world! This page serves as content for Assignment 2 of GUI, Fall 2013, as well as a home page for the course. To practice my web development chops, I will be filling this page with random content.</p>
  <p> This page was set to refresh every 5 seconds so that I don't have to wear out my Ctrl and R keys. I enjoyed creating this page and look forward to using a marquee.</p>

<!-- This will act as a 'Table of Contents' to display links to our Homework. 
     alongside CSS, a list was used -->
  <div class="center">
    <h2>Course Content</h2>
    A list item without a link is intentional.
    <ul>
