==========

Gui Project Sequence Repository
  Content includes eight assignments of UMASS Lowell's Fall 2013 GUI Programming course. This repo is mainly used to showcase the work I've done as a noob web developer. 

  Since the course is completed, any additional commits after 12/12/2013 will be minor, made only to refactor files or cosmetically polish the look of the pages. 
  
  You're welcome to leave any kind of feedback, and I'll be sure to update this readme as much as my schedule allows. Enjoy!
